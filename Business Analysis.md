## 1. Business environment
Relevant factors include:
*	Current and upcoming weather
*	Insurance laws and regulations
*	Current home-buying market
*	Technology
     *	Well-formatted digital reports
     * 	Integration with analog and digital testing equipment
     *	Timely writing and delivery of reports

## 2. Mission, goals, and objectives
TSI needs the proposed system to enhance the mold report writing process by compiling pictures and notes into a templated document and incorporating external lab test results.

## 3. Business model
The business mission should be achieved through the creation of software that can integrate the import process of pictures, text, and PDF documents into a text-editing application in a predefined format.

## 4. Information environment
The project portfolio for this proposed project includes only this project. Long-term plans include future integration into existing home inspection report software (HomeGauge). Data should be stored independently for each customer and each report, sorted by month and year in a tree file structure.

# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept

### a) Operational policies and constraints;
The main operational policies and constraints for the proposed system are well-supported templates and reliable information storage. Additionally, all files should be stored locally and grouped by year, month, then customer.

### b) Description of the proposed system;
The proposed system will allow the user to input photos and associated captions as well as other text inputs for specific remediation instructions. Input photos can also be cropped and enlarged as needed. The system will have support to compile a report during the inspection using a laptop computer, or after the inspection using any computer. The system will be designed to automatically save all changes. The system will then allow blocks to be reorganized and will automatically update formatting according to the selected template. PDF documents can then be inserted into the generated report, and the whole document can then be exported as a PDF to be sent to the customer using the HomeGauge system. Additionally, the system will have an interface for creating and editing the templates.

### c) Modes of system operation;
The two modes of operation for the proposed system will be during the mold assessment and after the mold assessment has been completed.

### d) User classes and other involved personnel
The Mold Assessor is the primary user class, and customer service also needs to be involved.

### e) Support environment
The proposed system will support Windows 10 computers.

## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios

### 5.2.1 Entering Information during Assessment
The Mold Assessor will use the input subsystem to add pictures and comments throughout the assessment.

### 5.2.2 Entering Information after Assessment
The Mold Assessor will use the input subsystem to add pictures and comments after the assessment.

### 5.2.3 Editing a New or Existing Report
The Mold Assessor will use the document editing subsystem to modify and rearrange pictures and comments.

### 5.2.4 Creating a New Template from a Blank Document
An employee will create a new template using the template building subsystem starting from a blank document.

### 5.2.5 Creating a New Template from an Existing Template
An employee will create a new template using the template building subsystem starting from an exsting template.

### 5.2.6 Editing an Existing Template
An employee will edit an exisiting template using the template building subsystem.

### 5.2.7 Deleting an Existing Template
An employee will delete an existing template using the template building subsystem with a confirmation of deletion.

### 5.2.8 Exporting Report for Customer
Customer Service will compile and export written reports to digitally transmit to customers.


# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
The preliminary acquisition concept for the proposed system is to interview the Mold Assessor, Customer Service, and other employees that would need to work with the proposed system. A step-by-step process of the current workflow will also be surveyed. The solution will be determined in collaborative meetings with the client. The requirements definition will be written in collaborative meetings with the client. The solicitation and contracting will be determined by negotiated with Human Resources. The design will be prototyped based on client meetings and presented for feedback at client meetings.

## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
During the testing phase the system will use provided sample data and will be compared against manually written reports. It will then be installed by customer service, and the software will be introduced to the users by going through the key functions in a training seminar and providing additional guides and resources.

## 6.3 Preliminary support concept
When an error occurs in the proposed system, the user can report the issue by providing the Error Log to customer support and receive feedback through customer support regarding how to work around the issue until a permanent fix can be implemented in the next update.

When the user is unfamiliar with the User Interface, the proposed system will have informational training resources provided online by customer support.

## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
To retire the proposed system, all associated installed applications will need to be uninstalled and all cache and log files will need to be deleted from the user's documents folder.


# 7. Project Constraints
To complete this project within the specified time and budget, only basic text-editing features will be fully utilized and an existing text-editing system will be employed as a starting point.
